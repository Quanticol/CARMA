## Companion of RCR Report for "Mesoscopic modelling of pedestrian movement using Carma and its tools"

"Mesoscopic modeling of pedestrian movement using {Carma} and its tools" uses Carma (Collective Adaptive Resource-sharing Markovian Agents), a specification language recently introduced for modeling CAS, to model spatially-distributed systems where the desired model lies between an individual-based (microscopic) and a population-based (macroscopic) spatial model. 
The impact on the system dynamics of changes to the topology of paths is studied via simulation. 
The provided experiments show that it is difficult to predict the effect of changes to the network structure and that even small variations can produce significant effects.
