We consider a robot search example where a swarm of robots move over city streets after a disaster. The robots enter the search area and spread out, searching. The first robot to find a casualty stops and broadcasts its location. Other robots rebroadcast it further while continuing to move. This is a flooding/gossiping protocol over a mobile ad hoc network (?). The base radio receives the location and starts broadcasting a return signal, which is repeated by all robots outside the base, as they move home.
