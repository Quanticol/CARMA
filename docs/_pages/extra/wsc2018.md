We consider a robot search example where a swarm of robots move over city streets after a disaster. The robots enter the search area and spread out, searching. The first robot to find a casualty stops and broadcasts its location. Other robots rebroadcast it further while continuing to move. This is a flooding/gossiping protocol over a mobile ad hoc network. The base radio receives the location and starts broadcasting a return signal, which is repeated by all robots outside the base, as they move home.

The archive file linked below can be used to get all Carma models and all the scripts needed to replicate the experiments conducted in the paper submitted at WSC 2018.
