<div>
This is an Eclipse plug-in developed for supporting specification and analysis of CAS in CARMA. In this plug-in, CARMA systems are specified by using an appropriate high-level language for designers of CAS, named the CARMA Specification Language. This is mapped to the process algebra, and hence will enable qualitative and quantitive analysis of CAS during system development by enabling a design workflow and analysis pathway. The intention of this high-level language is not to add to the expressiveness of CARMA, which we believe to be well-suited to capturing the behaviour of CAS, but rather to ease the task of modelling for users who are unfamiliar with process algebra and similar formal notations.
