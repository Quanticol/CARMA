# [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/)

Minimal Mistakes is a flexible two-column Jekyll theme. Perfect for hosting your personal site, blog, or portfolio on GitHub or self-hosting on your own server. As the name implies --- styling is purposely minimalistic to be enhanced and customized by you :smile:.

See what's new in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

:sparkles: Minimal Mistakes is now available as a [Ruby gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/minimal-mistakes-jekyll).

## Usage

For detailed instructions on how to configure, customize, add content, and more read the [theme's documentation](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/).

**Note:** Gem version of the theme requires Jekyll v3.3+ and is not currently supported on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). You can still use the theme with GitHub Pages, you'll just need to install using the old "[repo fork method](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/installation/)".

## Quick Start

Add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "minimal-mistakes-jekyll"
```

Add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml` file:

```yaml
theme: minimal-mistakes-jekyll
```

Then run Bundler to install the theme gem and dependencies:

```bash
bundle install
```

To update the theme run `bundle update`.

## Contributing

Having trouble working with the theme? Found a typo in the documentation? Interested in adding a feature or [fixing a bug](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues)? Then by all means [submit an issue](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/new) or [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). If this is your first pull request, it may be helpful to read up on the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) first.

Minimal Mistakes has been designed as a base for you to customize and fit your site's unique needs. Please keep this in mind when requesting features and/or submitting pull requests. If it's not something that most people will use, I probably won't consider it. When in doubt ask. 

This goes for author sidebar links and "share button" additions -- I have no intention of merging in every possibly option, the essentials are there to get you started :smile:.

### Pull Requests

When submitting a pull request:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Create a branch off of `master` and give it a meaningful name (e.g. `my-awesome-new-feature`) and describe the feature or fix.
3. Open a pull request on GitHub.

Theme documentation and demo pages can be found in the [`/docs`](docs) if submitting improvements, typo corrections, etc.

## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

To test the theme, run `bundle exec rake preview` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000/test/`. This starts a Jekyll server using content in the `test/` directory. As modifications are made to the theme and test site, it will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh.
